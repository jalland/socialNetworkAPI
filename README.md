# Social Network API

## Description

This application uses a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDb, with Mongoose, to create a Social Media API. A new user can be added, thoughts can be added to a user, and reactions can be added to thoughts. The API allows for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Link to Video Demonstration
Note that I had a bit of trouble at the end of the video with the adding/deleting reaction because I had the wrong ID values. I fixed them in the video so it would work.
