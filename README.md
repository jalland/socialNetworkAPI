# Social Network API

## Description

This application uses a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, with Mongoose, to create a Social Media API. With this API, a new user can be added, thoughts can be added to a user, and reactions can be added to thoughts. The API allows for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
